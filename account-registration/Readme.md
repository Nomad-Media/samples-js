## Nomad SDK NPM

To learn how to download and setup the nomad sdk npm, go to [Nomad SDK NPM](https://github.com/Nomad-Media/nomad-sdk/tree/main/nomad-sdk-npm).

## Setup

To run the Node application, follow these steps:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open a webpage and go to localhost:4200.

## Nomad SDK Files

In the nomad-sdk/js directory there are two versions of the Nomad SDK. There is the sdk.min.js file which is a minified version of the sdk, and the sdk-debug.js file which is a concatenated version of the sdk. The sdk-debug file will show you all the parameter documentation and readable code.

## Register User

For the inputs, you first need to enter your email into "Email" and click the "Register" button. Check your email to see if you received a code from Nomad.
